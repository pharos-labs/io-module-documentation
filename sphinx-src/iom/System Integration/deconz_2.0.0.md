### Triggers

[//]: # (Start with a verb such as "Fires when..." or "Receives...")

#### Updated connection

Fires when the connection to the gateway matches *Status*.

Matching properties:

* *Status*: 'Online', 'Offline, or 'ANY'

Trigger variables:

1. Online (*Boolean*)

### Conditions

[//]: # (Start with a verb such as "Matches if...")

#### Connected

Returns true if connected to the gateway.

Condition variables:

1. Online status 'Online', 'Offline', 'Access denied' (*String*)

### Actions

[//]: # (Start with a verb such as "Requests..." or "Starts...")

#### Set light state

Sends a request to the gateway to set the light state of *Light*.
There are multiple <code>Set light state</code> actions, each with a different subset of properties, covering a different aspect of light control.

**Note:** Depending on the target light, some properties may be ignored. e.g. When using *Switch*, the light is likely to ignore *Transition Time*.

Properties:

* *Light*: Target light ID
* *Switch*: Switch lamp 'On', 'Off', or leave as-is with 'Don't Change'
* *Brightness*: Lamp brightness (0-255)
* *CCT*: Colour temperature (kelvins)
* *Hue*: Colour hue (0-360Â°)
* *Saturation*: Colour saturation (0-255)
* *x* and *y*: CIE xy colour coordinates (0-1)
* *Transition time*: Fade time for state change (Seconds)

#### Recall scene

Recall a *Scene* from *Group*.

Properties:

* *Group*: Target group ID containing the Scene
* *Scene*: Target Scene ID

#### Store scene

Re-record *Scene* in *Group*.

Properties:

* *Group*: Target group ID containing the Scene
* *Scene*: Target Scene ID
