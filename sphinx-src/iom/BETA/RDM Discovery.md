## Module Summary

Discovers RDM-enabled fixtures and notifies of changes, including newly discovered, re-discovered, and missing fixtures.

## Module Status

[//]: # (**Note:** Please be aware that this is an BETA version of this IO Module which has not yet been fully tested. This is for evaluation purposes.)

**Note:** Please be aware that this is an BETA version of this IO Module which has not yet been fully tested.

### Known issues and limitations
#### Designer v2.9.2
* &nbsp; [MAG-11352] The controller _may_ unexpectedly reboot on the first discovery run after upload, subsequent discoveries operate without failure

#### VLC/Atlas hardware
* &nbsp; RDM Is not supported on these hardware platforms

If you encounter any issues with this module, or have any feedback regarding its operation, please contact our support team.

### Release Notes

#### Version 2.0.1.BETA4
* &nbsp; Added support for Rio G4

#### Version 2.0.1.BETA3
* &nbsp; Removed "Discovery Finished" Trigger
* &nbsp; Added "Discovery Report" trigger, with user customisable report messages
* &nbsp; Removed "Discovery Abort" options

#### Internal

* &nbsp; Module will not see multi-element fixtures as patched (MAG-9286).
* &nbsp; Every command is now broadcast but will only ever run on _all_ controllers or a specific controller (including network primary).
* &nbsp; Network primary handles _all_ Action and Trigger handling (broadcast back when discovery has finished on another controller).

###### Limitations

* &nbsp; Fixture names are currently just placeholders and generated by the module.

*Minor point releases (eg. 1.1.x) will be for small fixes and may not be listed here.*

## Operation

As of 2.0.1.BETA1, the module can be run on any controller on a network.<br>
Discovery Actions are called from the network-primary. Discovery status and data is fed back to the network primary to handle actions and triggering.<br>
If the network primary is not online, the module will not run.

A non-network-primary controller can only be responsible for universes it has configured and data will only show in the web interface if the *Controller Number* matches the controller number in the network tab.

### Instance Properties

*Controller Number* defines which controller should run the discovery.<br>
A non-network-primary controller can only be responsible for universes it has configured and data will only show in the web interface if the *Controller Number* matches the controller number in the network tab.

Specific universes and ports for supported protocols are specified in the *DMX Ports*, *Art-Net Universes*, *EDN 10 Ports* and *EDN 20* ports in comma-dash range format, eg. <code>0-1, 7, 9, 11-18</code>

<table class="formattedTable">
    <tr>
        <td>DMX</td>
        <td>Physical DMX port, indexed from 1<br>
        eg. <code>1</code> or <code>1-4</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Art-Net</td>
        <td>Art-Net Universe as an integer, indexed from 0<br>
        eg. <code>1</code> or <code>0,2,4</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>EDN 10, EDN 20, Rio G4</td>
        <td>EDN number and ports, indexed from 1<br>
        Formatted as: <code>[EDN number]:[port numbers]</code><br>
        eg. <code>1,2:1-10</code> will be EDNs 1 and 2 and ports 1-10 on both EDNs.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The *Monitored Fixture Range* defines which patched fixtures are to be monitored or leave blank to monitor all patched fixtures on the *Universe/Ports*.

Discovered fixtures not in *Monitored Fixture Range* will be treated as unpatched and therefore fire *Unpatched Fixture Discovered* Triggers.<br
They will still be displayed in the status variables along with all other discovered fixtures.

Checking the *Log Discovered Fixture* checkbox will print out a detailed table of all discovered fixtures, on completion of a *Discover Fixtures* Action.

Checking the *Log Triggers and Conditions* checkbox will provide more detailed logs message for Trigger and Condition matching.<br>
This is for diagnostic purposes and should be disabled during running to maintain controller performance.

*Export Data* defines whether the device information displayed in the status variables and Trigger variables is *As Description* or *As JSON*, *As Lua*  or *None*.

*User Message 1-3* are user customisable messages which can be used by the Trigger *Discovery Report*.<br>
Various arguments can be used, and will be automatically substituted upon use.

The returned variable is depended on the selected *Report Message*
* *Export Data*: Formatted data for parsing _all_ patched and non-patched fixtures, format type selectable by instance properties.
* *User message 1-3*: Formatted user string, with substituted arguments, message and arguments selectable by instance properties.

#### Patched Fixture Re-Discovered

Fires when a fixture has been re-discovered (i.e. not on first discovery), a fixture previously discovered was missing in a previous discovery, but was re-discovered in the most recent discovery. A Trigger will be fired _for each_ fixture in the *Fixture Number Range* that was rediscovered.

The *Fixture Number Range* must be in the comma-dash range format, eg. <code>0-1, 7, 9, 11-18</code> or if it left blank, any fixture number will match.

A Trigger will be fired _for each_ fixture in the *Fixture Number Range*.<br>
_n.b. Discoveries do not currently persist power cycles_

The *Fixture Number Range* must be in the comma-dash range format, eg. <code>0-1, 7, 9, 11-18</code> or if it left blank, any fixture number will match.

#### Unpatched Fixture Discovered

Fires when an unpatched fixture has been discovered, whether previously seen or not.<br>
A Trigger will be fired _for each_ fixture, if the fixture address is within the *Start Address Minimum* and *Start Address Maximum* range, and the footprint is between the *Footprint Minimum* and *Footprint Maximum* range.
